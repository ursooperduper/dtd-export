# dtd-export

This Adobe Photoshop script exports layers from Don't think... draw
PSDs, saving them as web-ready GIFs or JPGs.

There are two sets of PSDs it processes - thumbnails and full-size images.
The originating PSDs have prepared artwork in the desired dimensions.

Other items to note:
* Layers with just number labels are exported as GIFs.
* Layers with a number + "-color" are exported as JPGS.
* Thumbnail images have a light grey background.
* Fullsize images export with a white background.
